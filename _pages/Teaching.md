Electronics
=======
Electronics is the field of study or engineering practice related to active electron devices including diodes and transistors. This is in contrast to the field of linear circuits, with which you are already familiar, dealing with passive elements such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Active electron devices are often combined in a monolithic integrated circuit (IC) with supporting passive linear components to form microelectronics. Diodes and transistors are characterized by nonlinear current-voltage relationships (Vâ‰ IZ) which enable very important functions including amplification, frequency translation, oscillation, and switching. These functions, combined with filtering (from linear circuits) provide the building blocks for all modern electronic components including computers, cell-phones, audio/video equipment, power converters, and much more.

Systems & Circuits for Machine Learning
=======
This course studies major topics of hardware for machine learning, including deep learning basics, deep learning framework, digital accelerator design, analog/mixed-signal computation circuit design, emerging technologies for machine learning and so on. The design of the course is structured to provide students a systematic knowledge of hardware design for machine learning, from circuit fundamentals to algorithm optimization. Further, it aims to help students get exposed to state-of-art academic research and gain hands-on experience for industries.
