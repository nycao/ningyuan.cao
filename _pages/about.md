Ningyuan Cao is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. Before joining ND, he worked as a research assocaite for **IBM T.J. Watson** for one year. Ningyuan has been rewarded the Ph.D degree for **"Integrated Circuit and Algorithm Design for Edge Intelligence"** at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, where he was advised by Dr. Arijit Raychowdhury in 2020. Prior to his Ph.D., he had his Master's at **Columbia University** advised by Dr. Yannis Tsividis in 2015. He received his bachelar's degree from **Shanghai Jiaotong Unviersity** in 2013.

Ningyuan works at the intersection of **analog/mixed-signal circuit design, digital system design, machine learning algorithms, distributed intelligence** and **tactile internet**, where the fundamental & novel hardware techniques are investigated to empower future artificial intelligence in the internet of everything. Further, on the other end, he believes the future acceleration of hardware design will be enabled by data-driven machine learning approach and big data. As such, he is also interested in **IC design automation with data-driven methods**. His research interests in the intersection of hardware design and machine learning form a close-loop eco-system that enhance each other. His recent work seeks to address collaborative problem-solving capability of distributed devices with graph accelerators. Further, he works in fundamental graph-based circuit representation for integrated circuit design autoamtion.

Ningyuan published top-tier conference papers / journal papers in the field of solid-state circuit design, such as **ISSCC, JSSC, CICC, TCAS-I/II**, and other related field, such as **IMS, TIE**, SENSORS and so on. His works have been extensively supported by **Semiconductor Research Cooperation (SRC), Department of Energy (DOE) and IBM T.J. Watson**.
