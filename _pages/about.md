I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. Before joining ND, I worked as a research assocaite for IBM T.J. Watson for one year. I have been rewarded the Ph.D degree for "Integrated Circuit and Algorithm Design for Edge Intelligence" at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was advised by Dr. Arijit Raychowdhury in 2020. Prior to my Ph.D., I had my Master's at Columbia University advised by Dr. Yannis Tsividis in 2015. I received my bachelar's degree from Shanghai Jiaotong Unviersity in 2013.


**Research Interests**

My research interests are in (1) analog/mixed-signal circuit, digital architecture and IoT system design for machine learning acceleration/distributed intelligence and (2) custom IC design automation with data-driven methods.

**Perspective Students & PostDoc**

I am actively recruiting talented Ph.D., Master's and undergraduate students. I am looking forward to working with you on the exciting research fields of hardware accelerators for AI and AI-accelerated hardware designs. Prospective students should have strong background and/or interest in IC design and machine learning. 

I am also actively looking for experienced PostDocs to work with. Preferred expertise include hands-on experience with chip tape-out, AMS/digital circuit integration, independent research and student mentoring.
