I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. Before joining ND, I worked as a research assocaite for IBM T.J. Watson for one year. I have been rewarded the Ph.D degree for "Integrated Circuit and Algorithm Design for Edge Intelligence" in 2020 at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was advised by Dr. Arijit Raychowdhury. Prior to my Ph.D., I had my Master's at Columbia University  in 2015 advised by Dr. Yannis Tsividis. I received my bachelar's degree from Shanghai Jiaotong Unviersity in 2013. My works have been published/presented/reported by primary journals/conferences/press in various field of solid-state circuit design, microwave, industrial electronics and so on (ex. ISSCC, JSSC, TIE, IMS, CICC, TCAS-I and etc.)


**Research Interests:**
My research interests are in (1) analog/mixed-signal circuit, digital architecture and IoT system design for machine learning acceleration/distributed intelligence and (2) custom IC design automation with data-driven methods.

**Perspective Students & PostDoc:**
I am actively recruiting talented Ph.D., Master's and undergraduate students. I am looking forward to working with you on the exciting research fields of hardware accelerators for AI and AI-accelerated hardware designs. Prospective students should have strong background and/or interest in IC design and machine learning. I am also actively looking for experienced PostDocs to work with. Preferred expertise include hands-on experience with chip tape-out, AMS/digital circuit integration, independent research and student mentoring. **Please email "ncao at nd.edu" with your up-to-date CV. It is encouraged to read my prior papers first and give details in the email on how you can be a terrific match, those who provide specific evidences will be for primary considerations.**
