I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. Before joining ND, I worked as a research assocaite for IBM T.J. Watson for one year. I have been rewarded the Ph.D degree for "Integrated Circuit and Algorithm Design for Edge Intelligence" at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was advised by Dr. Arijit Raychowdhury in 2020. Prior to my Ph.D., I had my Master's at Columbia University advised by Dr. Yannis Tsividis in 2015. I received my bachelar's degree from Shanghai Jiaotong Unviersity in 2013.

I work at the intersection of _analog/mixed-signal circuit design, digital system design, machine learning algorithms, distributed intelligence_ and _tactile internet_, where the fundamental & novel hardware techniques are investigated to empower future artificial intelligence in the internet of everything. Further, on the other end, I believe the future acceleration of hardware design will be enabled by data-driven machine learning approach and big data. As such, I am also interested in _IC design automation_ with data-driven methods. My research interests are in the intersection of hardware design and machine learning which form a close-loop eco-system that enhance each other. My current work seeks to address collaborative problem-solving capability of distributed devices with graph accelerators. Further, I work in fundamental graph-based circuit representation for integrated circuit design autoamtion.

I have published top-tier conference papers / journal papers in the field of solid-state circuit design, such as ISSCC, JSSC, CICC, TCAS-I/II, and other related field, such as IMS, TIE and so on. His works have been extensively supported by Semiconductor Research Cooperation (SRC), Department of Energy (DOE) and IBM T.J. Watson. His works have been extensively reported by EETimes, GaTECH News, Science Daily and so on.
